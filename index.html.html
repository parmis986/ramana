  <h1>Bring Back Ramana</h1>

  <p>Dear Instagram Support Team,</p>

  <p>I hope this message finds you well.</p>

  <p>
    I am writing, along with many others, to respectfully request the review and restoration of the Instagram account <strong>@ramanasayahii</strong> which appears to have been recently disabled.
  </p>

  <p>
    This account has been a consistent voice for public awareness, compassion, and humanitarian efforts. She has contributed greatly to raising awareness on important social issues and supporting the well-being of others through meaningful content and action.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their removal from the platform has deeply upset a large number of followers who have benefited from their presence. The deletion of such an impactful and positive account feels not only unjustified, but also deeply disappointing to many in our community.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe this may have been a mistake and kindly ask for a manual review of the situation. We hope you will consider reinstating <strong>@ramanasayahii</strong> so they can continue their valuable work and service to others.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Personally, I truly need their presence on this platform.</strong></p>

  <p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
